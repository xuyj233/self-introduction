intro: >
  I am Yuanjian Xu (å¾å…ƒå?, a Ph.D. candidate in Fintech at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). My research asks how large language models can reason over complex financial signals, how neural stochastic differential equations capture market dynamics, and how domain-grounded alignment keeps models faithful to economic realities.

  I have published at ACL 2023, ACL 2025, and ICAIF 2025 with additional manuscripts under review at ICLR 2026, ICASS 2026, and ACL Rolling Review. I also review for NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI.
