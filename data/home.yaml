intro: |-
  馃憢 I am **Yuanjian Xu (寰愬厓鍋?**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Fintech** at the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)**.  

  My research focuses on:

  - **Interpretability and mechanistic understanding of generative models**
  - **Data-driven decision processes in LLMs**
  - **Uncertainty mechanisms in LLMs**

  I believe there remain many *unclear and foundational* questions in this field, and my work aims to bridge the gap between empirical discoveries and theoretical insights.

  馃 My research has been published at **ACL 2023**, **ACL 2025**, and **ICAIF 2025**, with additional manuscripts under review at **ICLR 2026**, **ICASSP 2026**, and **ACL Rolling Review**.

  鉁嶏笍 I also serve as a reviewer for leading conferences such as **NeurIPS 2025**, **ICLR 2024鈥?025**, and **AAAI 2024**.
