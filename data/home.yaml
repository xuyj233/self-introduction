intro: >
  I am Yuanjian Xu (徐元健), a Fintech Ph.D. candidate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) who previously earned my M.S. in Computer Science from Peking University and B.S. from Nankai University. My research investigates how large language models can reason about financial dynamics, bridging techniques such as neural stochastic differential equations and quantitative investment automation. I publish at venues including ACL and ICAIF, and serve as a reviewer for NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI.
