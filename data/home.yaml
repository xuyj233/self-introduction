intro: |-
ğŸ‘‹ I am **Yuanjian Xu (å¾å…ƒå?**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Fintech** at the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)** â€?an interdisciplinary program integrating **AI**, **statistics**, and **finance**.

My research focuses on:
- **Interpretability and mechanistic understanding of generative models**
- **Data-driven decision processes in LLMs**
- **Uncertainty mechanisms in LLMs**

I believe there remain many *unclear and foundational* questions in this field, and my work aims to bridge the gap between empirical discoveries and theoretical insights.

ğŸ§  My research has been published at **ACL 2023**, **ACL 2025**, and **ICAIF 2025**, with additional manuscripts under review at **ICLR 2026**, **ICASSP 2026**, and **ACL Rolling Review**.

âœï¸ I also serve as a reviewer for leading conferences such as **NeurIPS 2025**, **ICLR 2024â€?025**, and **AAAI 2024**.
