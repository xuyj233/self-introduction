## Profile

I am **Yuanjian Xu (徐元健)**, a Ph.D. candidate in Fintech at the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)**. My research asks how large language models can reason over complex financial signals, how neural stochastic differential equations capture market dynamics, and how domain-grounded alignment keeps models faithful to economic realities.

I have published at **ACL 2023**, **ACL 2025**, and **ICAIF 2025** with additional manuscripts under review at **ICLR 2026**, **ICASS 2026**, and **ACL Rolling Review**. I also review for **NeurIPS**, **ICLR**, and **AAAI**.
