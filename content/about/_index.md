I am a Ph.D. candidate in Fintech at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), where I study how large language models can support financial intelligence and decision-making. My recent work investigates alignment methods that let LLMs reason over financial events, stochastic dynamics, and domain-specific data at scale.

### Research Areas

- Alignment and interpretability techniques for large language models
- Neural stochastic differential equations for multi-modal market signals
- Financial time-series analysis and quantitative investment automation

### Academic Highlights

- Publications at ACL 2023, ACL 2025, and ICAIF 2025; additional manuscripts currently under review at ICLR 2026, ICASSP 2026, and ACL Rolling Review.
- Reviewer for NeurIPS, ICLR, and AAAI.
- Former research appointments at HKUST Society Hub, Tsinghua University AIR, and Peking University.
